# Cart-Abandonment---Swire
Examining cart abandonment for Swire's MyCoke360.

1. Summary of Business Problem & Project Objective

Cart abandonment is a major revenue leak for online retailors. As customers initiate the checkout process but fail to complete their purchase, revenue is left unrealized and customer intent remains uncertain. The objective of this project is to use customer, sales office, and transaction data to:
    -Identify which customer segments and locations exhibit the highest abandonment.
    -Quantify abandonment‑related churn risk.
    -Understand behavioral patterns that may indicate why customers do not complete checkout.
    -Provide actionable recommendations that reduce abandonment and improve conversion.

2. Group’s Solution to the Business Problem

Our team approached the problem using both exploratory and predictive analytics. Each member of the team cleaned and merged multiple datasets to identify customers with abandoned carts, calculated abandonment‑related churn rates by sales office and customer attributes, visualized patterns in churn, including location‑level differences and customer distribution, built classification models to evaluate which factors most strongly predict abandonment, and finally, delivered targeted recommendations such as improved follow‑up communication, optimized regional workflows, and enhanced customer experience touchpoints.

3. My Contribution to the Project

I contributed to the project in the following ways:
    -Cleaned and transformed customer‑level datasets, ensuring consistent identifiers across tables.
    -Analyzed abandonment behavior by merging customer and cart activity data.
    -Calculated churn rates and generated visualizations (heatmaps, bar charts, office‑level churn comparisons).
    -Built intermediate notebooks documenting workflow, data assumptions, and analytical decisions.
    -Drafted the final insights and helped translate model outputs into actionable business recommendations.

4. Business Value of the Solution

The solution provides measurable value to the business by:
    -Identifying high‑risk customer groups so that Swire can intervene earlier.  
    -Highlighting which sales offices face the greatest abandonment‑driven churn.
    -Supporting data‑backed decisions about staffing, workflow optimization, and customer outreach.
    -Enabling targeted marketing and follow‑up strategies aimed at increasing conversion.
    -Improving overall customer lifetime value by reducing leakage at a critical stage in the funnel.

5. Difficulties Encountered During the Project

Our group faced several challenges including inconsistent customer identifiers between different datasets required extensive data cleaning, missing and ambiguous values in the datasets, and different churn deinitions across datasets. Additionally, our early models suffered from feature imbalance and required tuning and reengineering.

6. What I Learned

Through this project, I gained experience in:
    -Working with real‑world data integrity issues and designing effective cleaning strategies.
    -Collaborating with a team on an end‑to‑end analytics workflow.
    -Visualizing geographic and categorical data to extract meaningful business insights.
    -Translating analytics into business recommendations that non‑technical stakeholders can use.
    -Understanding the operational impact of cart abandonment on both churn and revenue.
